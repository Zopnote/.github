Since I was eleven I'm interested in programming.
Started with Minecraft and Java, then Dart to write mobile apps and now **C++ as the language for what I've looking for**.

So I want this Github to **document** my process of learning, **upload** my projects **for safety** and **share** some information to other developers who experience a path like mine.
And it would be cool if anybody like my projects and use it:) I could **recommend some resources** for you: here

Yet it is planned to update the codebase of Shutter and bring my plan about ayse engine forward. And be good in school...
