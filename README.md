Since I was eleven I'm interested in programming.
Started with Minecraft Script as a really easy "language", then Java to create plugins, 
Dart to write mobile applications with Flutter and now C++ as the language for what I've looking for.
So I want this Github to document my process of learning, upload my projects for safety and share some information to other developers who experience a path like mine.
And it would be cool if anybody like my projects and use it:) If you're also still learning, I could recommend some resources for you: here
