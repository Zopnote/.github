Since I was eleven I'm interested in programming.
I would say that I'm often dream big, maybe to big but we will see.

So I want this Github to  **upload** my projects **for safety** and **share** some information.
Also I contribute to my main project dioxide. I want to make a fully 3D & 2D game engine that could be loved by a whole community.
